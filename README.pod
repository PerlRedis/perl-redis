=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pure perl bindings for L<https://redis.io/>

This version supports protocol 2.x (multi-bulk) or later of Redis available at
L<https://github.com/antirez/redis/>.

This documentation lists commands which are exercised in test suite, but
additional commands will work correctly since protocol specifies enough
information to support almost all commands with same piece of code with a
little help of C<AUTOLOAD>.

=head1 PIPELINING

Usually, running a command will wait for a response.  However, if you're doing
large numbers of requests, it can be more efficient to use what Redis calls
I<pipelining>: send multiple commands to Redis without waiting for a response,
then wait for the responses that come in.

To use pipelining, add a coderef argument as the last argument to a command
method call:

  $r->set('foo', 'bar', sub {});

Pending responses to pipelined commands are processed in a single batch, as
soon as at least one of the following conditions holds:

=over

=item *

A non-pipelined (synchronous) command is called on the same connection

=item *

A pub/sub subscription command (one of C<subscribe>, C<unsubscribe>,
C<psubscribe>, or C<punsubscribe>) is about to be called on the same
connection.

=item *

One of L</wait_all_responses> or L</wait_one_response> methods is called
explicitly.

=back

The coderef you supply to a pipelined command method is invoked once the
response is available.  It takes two arguments, C<$reply> and C<$error>.  If
C<$error> is defined, it contains the text of an error reply sent by the Redis
server.  Otherwise, C<$reply> is the non-error reply. For almost all commands,
that means it's C<undef>, or a defined but non-reference scalar, or an array
ref of any of those; but see L</keys>, L</info>, and L</exec>.

Note the contrast with synchronous commands, which throw an exception on
receipt of an error reply, or return a non-error reply directly.

The fact that pipelined commands never throw an exception can be particularly
useful for Redis transactions; see L</exec>.

=head1 ENCODING

There is no encoding feature anymore, it has been deprecated and finally
removed. This module consider that any data sent to the Redis server is a binary data.
And it doesn't do anything when getting data from the Redis server.

So, if you are working with character strings, you should pre-encode or post-decode it if needed !

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

    my $r = Redis->new; # $ENV{REDIS_SERVER} or 127.0.0.1:6379

    my $r = Redis->new( server => '192.168.0.1:6379', debug => 0 );
    my $r = Redis->new( server => '192.168.0.1:6379', encoding => undef );
    my $r = Redis->new( server => '192.168.0.1:6379', ssl => 1, SSL_verify_mode => SSL_VERIFY_PEER );
    my $r = Redis->new( sock => '/path/to/sock' );
    my $r = Redis->new( reconnect => 60, every => 5000 );
    my $r = Redis->new( password => 'boo' );
    my $r = Redis->new( on_connect => sub { my ($redis) = @_; ... } );
    my $r = Redis->new( name => 'my_connection_name' );
    my $r = Redis->new( name => sub { "cache-for-$$" });

    my $redis = Redis->new(sentinels => [ '127.0.0.1:12345', '127.0.0.1:23456' ],
                           service => 'mymaster');

    ## Connect via a list of Sentinels to a given service
    my $redis = Redis->new(sentinels => [ '127.0.0.1:12345' ], service => 'mymaster');

    ## Same, but with connection, read and write timeout on the sentinel hosts
    my $redis = Redis->new( sentinels => [ '127.0.0.1:12345' ], service => 'mymaster',
                            sentinels_cnx_timeout => 0.1,
                            sentinels_read_timeout => 1,
                            sentinels_write_timeout => 1,
                          );

=head3 C<< server >>

The C<< server >> parameter specifies the Redis server we should connect to,
via TCP. Use the 'IP:PORT' format. If no C<< server >> option is present, we
will attempt to use the C<< REDIS_SERVER >> environment variable. If neither of
those options are present, it defaults to '127.0.0.1:6379'.

Alternatively you can use the C<< sock >> parameter to specify the path of the
UNIX domain socket where the Redis server is listening.

Alternatively you can use the C<< sentinels >> parameter and the C<< service >>
parameter to specify a list of sentinels to contact and try to get the address
of the given service name. C<< sentinels >> must be an ArrayRef and C<< service
>> an Str.

The C<< REDIS_SERVER >> can be used for UNIX domain sockets too. The following
formats are supported:

=over

=item *

/path/to/sock

=item *

unix:/path/to/sock

=item *

127.0.0.1:11011

=item *

tcp:127.0.0.1:11011

=back

=head3 C<< reconnect >>, C<< every >>

The C<< reconnect >> option enables auto-reconnection mode. If we cannot
connect to the Redis server, or if a network write fails, we enter retry mode.
We will try a new connection every C<< every >> microseconds (1 ms by
default), up-to C<< reconnect >> seconds.

Be aware that read errors will always thrown an exception, and will not trigger
a retry until the new command is sent.

If we cannot re-establish a connection after C<< reconnect >> seconds, an
exception will be thrown.

=head3 C<< conservative_reconnect >>

C<< conservative_reconnect >> option makes sure that reconnection is only attempted
when no pending command is ongoing. For instance, if you're doing
C<<$redis->incr('key')>>, and if the server properly understood and processed the
command, but the network connection is dropped just before the server replies :
the command has been processed but the client doesn't know it. In this
situation, if reconnect is enabled, the Redis client will reconnect and send
the C<incr> command *again*. If it succeeds, at the end the key as been
incremented *two* times. To avoid this issue, you can set the C<conservative_reconnect>
option to a true value. In this case, the client will reconnect only if no
request is pending. Otherwise it will die with the message: C<reconnect
disabled while responses are pending and safe reconnect mode enabled>.

=head3 C<< cnx_timeout >>

The C<< cnx_timeout >> option enables connection timeout. The Redis client will
wait at most that number of seconds (can be fractional) before giving up
connecting to a server.

=head3 C<< sentinels_cnx_timeout >>

The C<< sentinels_cnx_timeout >> option enables sentinel connection timeout.
When using the sentinels feature, Redis client will wait at most that number of
seconds (can be fractional) before giving up connecting to a sentinel.
B<Default>: 0.1

=head3 C<< read_timeout >>

The C<< read_timeout >> option enables read timeout. The Redis client will wait
at most that number of seconds (can be fractional) before giving up when
reading from the server.

=head3 C<< sentinels_read_timeout >>

The C<< sentinels_read_timeout >> option enables sentinel read timeout. When
using the sentinels feature, the Redis client will wait at most that number of
seconds (can be fractional) before giving up when reading from a sentinel
server. B<Default>: 1

=head3 C<< write_timeout >>

The C<< write_timeout >> option enables write timeout. The Redis client will wait
at most that number of seconds (can be fractional) before giving up when
reading from the server.

=head3 C<< sentinels_write_timeout >>

The C<< sentinels_write_timeout >> option enables sentinel write timeout. When
using the sentinels feature, the Redis client will wait at most that number of
seconds (can be fractional) before giving up when reading from a sentinel
server. B<Default>: 1

=head3 C<< password >>

If your Redis server requires authentication, you can use the C<< password >>
attribute. After each established connection (at the start or when
reconnecting), the Redis C<< AUTH >> command will be send to the server. If the
password is wrong, an exception will be thrown and reconnect will be disabled.

=head3 C<< on_connect >>

You can also provide a code reference that will be immediately after each
successful connection. The C<< on_connect >> attribute is used to provide the
code reference, and it will be called with the first parameter being the Redis
object.

=head3 C<< no_auto_connect_on_new >>

You can also provide C<< no_auto_connect_on_new >> in which case C<<
new >> won't call C<< $obj->connect >> for you implicitly, you'll have
to do that yourself. This is useful for figuring out how long
connection setup takes so you can configure the C<< cnx_timeout >>
appropriately.

=head3 C<< no_sentinels_list_update >>

You can also provide C<< no_sentinels_list_update >>. By default (that is,
without this option), when successfully contacting a sentinel server, the Redis
client will ask it for the list of sentinels known for the given service, and
merge it with its list of sentinels (in the C<< sentinels >> attribute). You
can disable this behavior by setting C<< no_sentinels_list_update >> to a true
value.

=head3 C<< name >>

You can also set a name for each connection. This can be very useful for
debugging purposes, using the C<< CLIENT LIST >> command. To set a connection
name, use the C<< name >> parameter. You can use both a scalar value or a
CodeRef. If the latter, it will be called after each connection, with the Redis
object, and it should return the connection name to use. If it returns a
undefined value, Redis will not set the connection name.

Please note that there are restrictions on the name you can set, the most
important of which is, no spaces. See the L<CLIENT SETNAME
documentation|https://redis.io/commands/client-setname> for all the juicy
details. This feature is safe to use with all versions of Redis servers. If C<<
CLIENT SETNAME >> support is not available (Redis servers 2.6.9 and above
only), the name parameter is ignored.

=head3 C<< ssl >>

You can connect to Redis over SSL/TLS by setting this flag if the target Redis
server or cluster has been setup to support SSL/TLS.  This requires IO::Socket::SSL
to be installed on the client.  It's off by default.

=head3 C<< SSL_verify_mode >>

This parameter will be applied when C<< ssl >> flag is set.  It sets the verification
mode for the peer certificate.  It's compatible with the parameter with the same name
in IO::Socket::SSL.

=head3 C<< debug >>

The C<< debug >> parameter enables debug information to STDERR, including all
interactions with the server. You can also enable debug with the C<REDIS_DEBUG>
environment variable.

=head1 CONNECTION HANDLING

=head2 connect

  $r->connect;

Connects to the Redis server. This is done by default when the obect is
constructed using C<new()>, unless C<no_auto_connect_on_new> has been set. See
this option in the C<new()> constructor.

=head2 quit

  $r->quit;

Closes the connection to the server. The C<quit> method does not support
pipelined operation.

=head2 ping

  $r->ping || die "no server?";

The C<ping> method does not support pipelined operation.

=head1 PIPELINE MANAGEMENT

=head2 wait_all_responses

Waits until all pending pipelined responses have been received, and invokes the
pipeline callback for each one.  See L</PIPELINING>.

=head2 wait_one_response

Waits until the first pending pipelined response has been received, and invokes
its callback.  See L</PIPELINING>.

=head1 PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE COMMANDS

When one of L</subscribe> or L</psubscribe> is used, the Redis object will
enter I<PubSub> mode. When in I<PubSub> mode only commands in this section,
plus L</quit>, will be accepted.

If you plan on using PubSub and other Redis functions, you should use two Redis
objects, one dedicated to PubSub and the other for regular commands.

All Pub/Sub commands receive a callback as the last parameter. This callback
receives three arguments:

=over

=item *

The published message.

=item *

The topic over which the message was sent.

=item *

The subscribed topic that matched the topic for the message. With L</subscribe>
these last two are the same, always. But with L</psubscribe>, this parameter
tells you the pattern that matched.

=back

See the L<Pub-Sub notes|https://redis.io/topics/pubsub> for more information
about the messages you will receive on your callbacks after each L</subscribe>,
L</unsubscribe>, L</psubscribe> and L</punsubscribe>.

=head2 publish

  $r->publish($topic, $message);

Publishes the C<< $message >> to the C<< $topic >>.

=head2 subscribe

  $r->subscribe(
      @topics_to_subscribe_to,
      my $savecallback = sub {
        my ($message, $topic, $subscribed_topic) = @_;
        ...
      },
  );

Subscribe one or more topics. Messages published into one of them will be
received by Redis, and the specified callback will be executed.

=head2 unsubscribe

  $r->unsubscribe(@topic_list, $savecallback);

Stops receiving messages via C<$savecallback> for all the topics in
C<@topic_list>. B<WARNING:> it is important that you give the same calleback
that you used for subscribtion. The value of the CodeRef must be the same, as
this is how internally the code identifies it.

=head2 psubscribe

  my @topic_matches = ('prefix1.*', 'prefix2.*');
  $r->psubscribe(@topic_matches, my $savecallback = sub { my ($m, $t, $s) = @_; ... });

Subscribes a pattern of topics. All messages to topics that match the pattern
will be delivered to the callback.

=head2 punsubscribe

  my @topic_matches = ('prefix1.*', 'prefix2.*');
  $r->punsubscribe(@topic_matches, $savecallback);

Stops receiving messages via C<$savecallback> for all the topics pattern
matches in C<@topic_list>. B<WARNING:> it is important that you give the same
calleback that you used for subscribtion. The value of the CodeRef must be the
same, as this is how internally the code identifies it.

=head2 is_subscriber

  if ($r->is_subscriber) { say "We are in Pub/Sub mode!" }

Returns true if we are in I<Pub/Sub> mode.

=head2 wait_for_messages

  my $keep_going = 1; ## Set to false somewhere to leave the loop
  my $timeout = 5;
  $r->wait_for_messages($timeout) while $keep_going;

Blocks, waits for incoming messages and delivers them to the appropriate
callbacks.

Requires a single parameter, the number of seconds to wait for messages. Use 0
to wait for ever. If a positive non-zero value is used, it will return after
that amount of seconds without a single notification.

Please note that the timeout is not a commitment to return control to the
caller at most each C<timeout> seconds, but more a idle timeout, were control
will return to the caller if Redis is idle (as in no messages were received
during the timeout period) for more than C<timeout> seconds.

The L</wait_for_messages> call returns the number of messages processed during
the run.

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTES ON METHODS

=head2 methods that return multiple values

When a method returns more than one value, it checks the context and returns
either a list of values or an ArrayRef.

=head2 transaction-handling methods

B<Warning:> the behaviour of the TRANSACTIONS commands when combined with
pipelining is still under discussion, and you should B<NOT> use them at the
same time just now.

You can L<follow the discussion to see the open issues with
this|https://github.com/PerlRedis/perl-redis/issues/17>.

=head2 exec

  my @individual_replies = $r->exec;

C<exec> has special behaviour when run in a pipeline: the C<$reply> argument to
the pipeline callback is an array ref whose elements are themselves C<[$reply,
$error]> pairs.  This means that you can accurately detect errors yielded by
any command in the transaction, and without any exceptions being thrown.

=head2 keys

  my @keys = $r->keys( '*glob_pattern*' );
  my $keys = $r->keys( '*glob_pattern*' ); # count of matching keys

Note that synchronous C<keys> calls in a scalar context return the number of
matching keys (not an array ref of matching keys as you might expect).  This
does not apply in pipelined mode: assuming the server returns a list of keys,
as expected, it is always passed to the pipeline callback as an array ref.

=head2 hashes

Hashes in Redis cannot be nested as in perl, if you want to store a nested
hash, you need to serialize the hash first. If you want to have a named
hash, you can use Redis-hashes. You will find an example in the tests
of this module t/01-basic.t

=head2 eval

Note that this commands sends the Lua script every time you call it. See
L</evalsha> and L</script_load> for an alternative.

=head2 info

  my $info_hash = $r->info;

The C<info> method is unique in that it decodes the server's response into a
hashref, if possible. This decoding happens in both synchronous and pipelined
modes.
